# Factory Method

It defines an interface for creating an object, but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creation being deferred at run-time.
A simple real life example of the Factory Method is the payment methods.
One of the advantages is that you can easily add new forms of payment.

# Abstract Factory

It provides a way to encapsulate a group of **individual factories** that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
In this example we have an abstract factory that groups together a warrior factory and an weapon factory.
